    "summary": "his is Samiul Haque. I have completed my graduation in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University, Bangladesh. I am extremely  passionate about technology. Since my university life I have joined many technical organizations to boost up my knowledge. I have participated in several national and international technical competitions. Starting with a simple light sensor, I have made  PID controlled advanced line following robot and autonomous sumo fighting robot. During the last two years of undergrad I solely focused on research. My expertise  is focused on IoT, Machine Learning and Image Processing. I have developed  several real life IoT  projects. Furthermore, I have completed several biomedical projects with the integration of Machine Learning and Image Processing. Currently, I am working as a Junior Software Engineer (Machine Learning) at Agrohi and passionate about exploring new research areas with the  integration of IoT and Machine Learning.",
