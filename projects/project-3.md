To know and get real life experience on circuit design, PCB febrication, i thought why not make a calculator with the capabilities of performing scientific operation. From that thought, i started to design with cheap but powerfull esp 8266 soc. The display liberies used in the project is u86f. The full circuit design and PCB layout is abalible in this [link] (https://easyeda.com/editor#id=7aeca7a23e6c4779ad568054f154b74f|4771d9ba730444b49f8c3ca4d3c30b9d|4d9683e1f7284cb6978e3456bfbe43ca). The code i had written , i had used Arduino and C++ for mathmatical calculation. The code can be found in this [Link] (https://github.com/samiulextreem/Device_advance).
