During covid emergency, there was ton of classifier for covid detection using chest image x-ray. But there was little to no study how much vulnerability is present in the model against adversarial attack.

The project mainly focused on studing the issue in two main section. One was targeted attack on the classifier and another was non targeted attack. We found that both type of attack was possible on the networks.
